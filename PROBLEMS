Known Problems
==============

Printers
--------

* No difference between de ' and ` quotes.
  This is a printer font problem. A close inspection shows that
  the ' (right quote) is thicker at the top while ` (the left quote) is
  thicker at the bottom.

  This problem is common with Ghostscript, that uses the Courier font
  as donated by IBM to the X Consortium. A solution is to download
  Adobe Acrobat from ftp.adobe.com. It comes with a full set of
  Postscript fonts (which are the *REAL* ones!). You can then instruct
  Ghostscript to use these fonts instead by modifying the Fontmap file
  in the Ghostscript library.

* Some printers (or printing systems) seem to have problems with the

    %%Feature: *Resolution 300dpi

  line in the postscript file. This line can be safely deleted if needed.

* The PostScript file, as distributed, selects A4 paper format. This
  is intentional, even for US Letter paper format.
  If your printer chokes on this, you can change the line 
 
    a4

  info

    letter

  (And you'll probably have to adjust the document alignment
  parameters as well.) 

Angus Dunnan's PostScript utilities
-----------------------------------
* Makefile.psutils can be used to create A4 based reference copies
  using psutils version 1.13. Your mileage may vary.
